# Deprecated

Do not use this.  It is out of date.

Instead, use the repository called `parse_ird_summaries`.  It was
created after this one, and uses many of the code techniques and
approaches that were worked out here, but that repo is far more
modularized, and contains better tests.

Plus it is maintained, and this one is not.
